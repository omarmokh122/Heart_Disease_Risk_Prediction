**Introduction**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death globally. Early detection of individuals at high risk of developing heart disease can be crucial.

This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. By leveraging machine learning models, we will identify significant risk factors and develop a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals.

**Dataset Overview**

The dataset used in this study is publicly available on Kaggle and originates from the Framingham Heart Study. It includes over 4,000 records with 15 attributes related to demographics, behavior, and medical history.

**Key Attributes:**


Demographic: Age, Gender, Education
Behavioral: Smoking habits, Cigarettes per day
Medical History: Blood pressure medication, Hypertension, Diabetes, Stroke history
Current Medical Condition: Cholesterol levels, Blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), Heart rate, Glucose levels
Target Variable: 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (binary classification: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Objective
The primary objective is to build a robust model that accurately predicts the 10-year risk of CHD. We will explore various machine learning algorithms, perform feature selection and scaling, and address class imbalance to improve model performance.

**Methodology**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data, check for missing values, and visualize distributions.
Feature Engineering: Select and prepare relevant features for modeling.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms.
Model Training: Train the models on the prepared data, optimizing hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
Deployment (Optional): Deploy the best model for real-world applications.
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.
